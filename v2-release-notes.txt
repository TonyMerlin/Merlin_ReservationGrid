#Merlin's Reservation Grid V2

1) Module dependencies (etc/module.xml)  
   We were depending on Magento_Inventory, but the table we're using (inventory_reservation) is actually created by the Magento_InventoryReservations module.
    Reordered the sequence so that InventoryReservations comes first, then UI.

2) ACL + menu (etc/acl.xml)  
   Our menu item lives under Sales (Magento_Sales::sales) so ACL should mirror that.

3) Controllers  
   Removed the unnecessary CsrfAwareActionInterface from Index (GETs don't need it).
   Injected model factory via constructor rather than using $this->_objectManager.  
   Cast incoming IDs to int, catch LocalizedException separately.

4) UI-component listing (view/adminhtml/ui_component/reservation_grid.xml)  
 We declared an exportButton but have no ExportCsv/ExportXml controllers, We removed it from here.  
 actionsColumn had no delete link defined; We've added it.

5) added an i18n/en_US.csv to ship default translations.

With the above code changes:

- We no longer use the ObjectManager in the controllers.  
- The ACL now lives under Magento_Sales.  
- The module sequence guarantees the MSI reservation table is present.  
- The grid will display a per' row Delete link and a working mass delete action but no broken Export button.  
- No more obsolete CSRF overrides on a pure GET action.
